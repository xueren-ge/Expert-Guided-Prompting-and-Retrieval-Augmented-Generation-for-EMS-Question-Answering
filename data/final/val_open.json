        "explanation": "frostbite is the most serious local cold injury because the tissues are actually frozen. freezing permanently damages cells, although the exact mechanism by which damage occurs is unknown. the presence of ice crystals within the cells may cause physical damage. the change in the water content in the cells may also cause changes in the concentration of critical electrolytes, producing permanent changes in the chemistry of the cell. when the ice thaws, further chemical changes occur in the cell, causing permanent damage or cell death, called necrosis or gangrene. if gangrene occurs, the dead tissue may need to be surgically removed, sometimes by amputation. following less severe damage, the exposed part will become inflamed, tender to touch, and unable to tolerate exposure to cold. immersion foot, also called trench foot, occurs after prolonged exposure to cold water. it is particularly common in hikers or hunters who stand for a long time in a river or lake. the skin may freeze after prolonged exposure to the cold, whereas the deeper tissues are unaffected. this condition, which often affects the ears, nose, and fingers, is called frostnip. because frostnip is usually painless, the patient is often unaware that a cold injury has occurred.",

(this is the standard adopted and used by the nremt for testing purposes). the aha guidelines for a choking victim who is still able to move air is to encourage the patient to cough in an attempt to remove the obstruction. you would not administer abdominal thrusts to a patient who is still moving air.",
