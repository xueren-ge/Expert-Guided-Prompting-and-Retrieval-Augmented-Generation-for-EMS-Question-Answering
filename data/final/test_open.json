        "explanation": "the american burn association classifies burns as being minor, moderate, or severe. however, your local protocols or regional burn center may have slightly different criteria. minor burns in an adult include full-thickness burns that cover less than 2% of bsa, partial-thickness burns that cover less than 15% of bsa, and superficial burns that cover less than 50% of bsa. moderate burns include full-thickness burns that cover between 2% to 10% of bsa (excluding burns to critical areas of the body), partial-thickness burns that cover 15% to 30% of bsa, and superficial burns that cover more than 50% of bsa. severe burns include any full-thickness burn to a critical area of the body, full-thickness burns that cover more than 10% of bsa to noncritical areas of the body, and partial-thickness burns that cover more than 30% of bsa.",

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "*generalized* seizures are characterized by severe muscle twitching that lasts several minutes or longer. an *aura* is not a seizure, but rather a warning sign some patients feel before a seizure. *simple partial seizures* usually do not cause severe twitching. generalized (tonic-clonic) seizures are characterized by severe muscle twitching that lasts several minutes or longer. formerly called grand mal seizures, there are two phases called the tonic and clonic phases. the tonic phase usually lasts a few seconds, where the patient has constant muscle contraction, trembling, bladder incontinence, and tongue biting. the clonic phase consists of the patient with intense jerking movements that affect the face, arms, and legs. these rapid movements typically last one to three minutes before slowing down and the body relaxes. \n \n *status epilepticus* has typically referred to seizures lasting 30 minutes or longer. however, the epilepsy foundation reports the length of time has shortened over the years because most seizures do not last longer than 2 minutes. status epilepticus is now defined as a seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes or when seizures occur close together and the person does not return to a normal level of consciousness between episodes. please check your emt study source for local, up-to-date guidelines about this term.",

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "in normal physiological processes, sensors throughout the body send signals to the breathing centers in the brain, telling the brain that levels of co2 in arterial blood are too high and that the person needs to ventilate at a faster rate to get rid of the co2. in copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients, it is often seen that patients are driven by a hypoxic drive. this means that sensors in the body detect low levels of o2 in the arterial blood and send signals to breathing centers in the brain to control ventilation muscles at a faster rate to bring in increased levels of oxygen. a venturi mask is needed since the amount of o2 delivered is set at very precise rates to ensure that the arterial levels of o2 do not exceed levels that stop the patient from breathing.",

        "explanation": "when you encounter resistance while inserting a nasal airway and cannot insert it into the right nostril, the correct response is to try the other nostril and be sure you have lubricated the device. this approach can help avoid trauma to the nasal passages and facilitate easier insertion. it's important to use appropriate lubrication and to avoid using force, which could cause injury. if resistance is still met in the other nostril, you may consider trying a smaller size, but force should never be used to insert a nasal airway. an oral airway will not be tolerated with a patient with an intact gag reflex.",
