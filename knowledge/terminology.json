        "Terminology": "This section provides definitions for various medical and safety terms used by professional responders. Key terms include Abruptio Placentae, which refers to premature separation of the placenta from the uterus, characterized by uterine contractions, bleeding, and fetal distress. Aspiration involves inhaling solids or liquids into the lungs, such as food, vomit, or blood. The boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid changes into a vapor or gas. BSI stands for Body Substance Isolation equipment, commonly referred to as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which includes gloves and safety glasses. CHEMTREC offers emergency Hazardous Materials (HazMat) support. Flashpoint is the lowest temperature at which vapors ignite when exposed to an ignition source. HazMat - Cold Zone, also known as the Outer Perimeter, is an area far enough from hazardous materials to eliminate contamination risk. HazMat - Hot Zone, or Contaminated Area, is the area immediately contaminated by a hazardous material. HazMat - Warm Zone, or Inner Perimeter, is an area outside the hot zone with reduced contamination risk, typically where responder decontamination procedures occur. Ignition Temperature is the lowest temperature at which a substance spontaneously ignites without an ignition source. MSDS, or Material Safety Data Sheet, contains information about potential hazards of chemical products used in the workplace. Palliate means to ease or lessen discomfort. Placenta Previa occurs when the baby's placenta partially or completely covers the mother's cervix, leading to severe bleeding. Priapism is a sustained erection caused by spinal cord injury. Status Asthmaticus is acute asthma that remains unresponsive to treatment with bronchodilators. Tidal Volume is the volume of air moved into and out of the lungs during each ventilation cycle, approximately 500ml per inspiration in a normal healthy adult. Vehicle Placard is a diamond-shaped sign identifying the class of dangerous goods/hazardous materials on large containers and vehicles.",
        "Chest Auscultation Points": "This section illustrates the chest auscultation points for assessing respiratory sounds. It shows three diagrams labeled (a), (b), and (c), each depicting different areas of the chest where auscultation should be performed. Diagram (a) focuses on the right anterior axillary line, midsternal line, and right midclavicular line, highlighting the first intercostal space, superior lobe, middle lobe, inferior lobe, seventh intercostal space, and inferior lobe. Diagram (b) emphasizes the superior lobe, middle lobe, and inferior lobe, focusing on the right side of the chest. Diagram (c) highlights the vertebral line, scapular line, superior lobe, middle lobe, and inferior lobe, focusing on the back of the chest. The instructions advise auscultating at least six points during each assessment, allowing two full breaths to go in and out at each point."
